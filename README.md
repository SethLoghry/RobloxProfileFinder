## Explanation
This code will simply verify if a profile exists or not and if it does, it will output the profile ID to a file named "existent_profiles.txt". 

Yes, that's basically it.

## Variables to be defined
This code will run from all the profiles that you put in the following variables.
```
starting_profile = 1
end_profile = 10000000
```
The ``starting_profile`` is to define from what profile should the bot start from.
The ``end_profile`` is to define what profile the bot should end.

## Running
To run this awful project, just run in your terminal:
```
python3 profile_finder.py
```

## More things
I don't know why i did this code. I hoped it would be useful for someone.
